3. About
--------

The 3D City Database Importer/Exporter Matching/Merging Plugin 
is an extension of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter program.
It allows for identifying building objects within the database which
occupy the same spatial area (partially or completely). Candidate
matches can be merged into a single building object. 


4. Requirements
---------------

This version of the Matching/Merging Plugin shall only be used with
version 1.4-devel of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter. 
It cannot be guaranteed that the extension does correctly work with any
previous or later version of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter.


5. (Un)Installation
-------------------

The installation of the Matching/Merging Plugin is automatically 
carried out by the universal installer during the setup procedure
of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter if the corresponding 
installation package has been chosen by the user.

The plugin is shipped as a precompiled and ready-to-use JAR package
called "matching-merging.jar". The universal installer will put this JAR
package into the "plugins/de.tub.citydb.plugins.matching-merging" subfolder
within the installation folder of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter.

If you want to uninstall the Matching/Merging Plugin, simply delete
the "de.tub.citydb.plugins.matching-merging" subfolder and all its
