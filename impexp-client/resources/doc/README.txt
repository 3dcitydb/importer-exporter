3. About
--------

The @name@ is a Java based front-end for 
the @citydbName@ version @citydbVersion@. It allows for high-performance 
loading and extracting 3D city model data.

* Full support for CityGML versions 2.0.0 and 1.0.0
* Support for CityGML Application Domain Extensions (ADEs) through
  software extensions
* Support for Oracle Locator/Spatial and PostgreSQL/PostGIS
* Reading/writing CityGML instance documents of arbitrary file size
* Export of KML/COLLADA/glTF models including tiling schemas for 
  visualization and interactive exploration of large city models
  in Digital Earth Browsers, 3D GIS, and computer graphics software
* Generic KML information balloons
* Export of thematic object data into tables. Supported data formats are
  CSV, Microsoft Excel, and direct upload into Google Spreadsheets
* Resolving and preservation of forward and backwards XLinks in 
  CityGML datasets
* Full support of 3D Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) and 3D 
  coordinate transformations; support for user-defined CRS 
* Coordinate transformations for CityGML exports
* Map window for graphical selection of bounding boxes
* XML validation of CityGML instance documents
* Multithreaded programming facilitating high-performance CityGML 
  processing

The @name@ comes with both a Graphical
User Interface (GUI) and a Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI 
allows for employing the tool in batch processing workflows and 
third party applications.


4. System requirements
----------------------

* Java JRE or JDK >= 1.8
* @citydbName@ version @citydbVersion@ on
  - Oracle Spatial DBMS >= 10G R2 with Spatial or Locator option
  - PostgreSQL DBMS >= 9.3 with PostGIS extension >= 2.0
  
The @name@ can be run on any platform 
providing appropriate Java support. It has been tested on the 
following platforms:
  - Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, 8, 10
  - Apple Mac OS X 10.9, 10.11, macOS 10.12, 10.13
  - Ubuntu 14 - 18


5. (Un)Installation
-------------------

It is recommended to use the universal installer to setup the
@name@ application on your local computer.
The universal installer will guide you through the steps of the
installation process. Afterwards, you can immediately run the application 
(see next section).

When you successfully install the @name@,
an uninstaller is automatically generated in the 'uninstaller' subfolder
of the installation directory. Please use this uninstaller in order to remove
the @name@ application files from your
computer. Alternatively, you can simply delete the entire installation
directory.


6. Running the application
--------------------------

For running the @name@ use one of the
following two options:

a) Recommended:
   Use the start scripts to launch the application. The start scripts
   are located in the "bin" folder of the installation directory.
   During setup you can additionally choose to create shortcuts for the
   start scripts on your desktop and in the start menu of your
   preferred OS.

   Please execute the start script suitable for your platform:
   - @appName@.bat   (Microsoft Windows family)
   - @appName@       (UNIX/Linux family, macOS)

   On most platforms, double-clicking the start script or its shortcut
   runs the @name@.

   PLEASE NOTE:
   The start scripts set the initial heap size of the Java Virtual
   Machine (JVM) to 1GB using the -Xms parameter of the JVM. This value
   has been chosen to be reasonable for most platforms. Please edit the
   start scripts in case you need to adapt the default values (e.g.,
   in order to increase the available main memory).

   For some UNIX/Linux distributions, you will have to run the start
   script from within a shell environment. Please open your favorite shell
   and first check whether execution rights are correctly set for the
   start script.

   Change to the "bin" folder and enter the following to make the start
   script executable for the owner of the file:

       chmod u+x @appName@

   Afterwards, simply run the start script by the following command:

       ./@appName@

b) Alternatively, you can directly run the @jar@
   from within a shell environment without using the start scripts. The
   runnable JAR archive is located in the "lib" subfolder of the
   installation folder.

   Open a shell, change to the installation folder and type the following:

       java -jar lib/@jar@ [-options]

   Make sure to define reasonable values for the available main memory.
   Otherwise you might quickly run into main memory issues due
   to restrictive JVM default values.

   This is also the recommended way to run the program in CLI mode without
   a graphical user interface. Simply add the "-shell" program argument to
   the above shell command:

       java -jar lib/@jar@ -shell [-options]

   Type "java -jar lib/@jar@ -help" to get a list of the
   available program arguments.
