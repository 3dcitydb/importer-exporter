Change Log
==========

### Pending changes

* CityJSON import (already working in `master`). [#88](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/88)
* CityJSON export. [#89](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/89)

### 4.2.3 - 2019-03-xx

##### Additions
* Added support for sorting the top-level features in a CityGML export based on one or more 
simple thematic attributes. The sorting criteria can be defined using the new `<sortBy>` element of
the XML query language. [#86](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/pull/86)
* Added support for implicit geometries of nested sub-features in KML/COLLADA/glTF exports. [#93](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/93),
[#94](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/pull/94)
* Added a delete operation to the CLI through the new `-delete` option. A corresponding `<delete>` element in the
config file lets you define the behavior of the delete operation (e.g. by providing a filter expression). [#102](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/pull/102)
* Added support for importing `gml:PolygonPatch` geometry objects.
* Added installation via CLI to the documentation. [#99](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/99) 
* Added import and export counter for global appearances. [#95](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/95),
[#115](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/pull/115)
* Added date picker in GUI.
* Added a link to the [online documentation](https://3dcitydb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/release-v4.2.3/) in the `Help` menu of the GUI.

##### Changes
* Reworked the feature counter filter for CityGML imports and exports. Instead of providing a lower and upper
boundary, you can now provide the total `count` of features and the `start index` of the first feature. For 
exports, this is mapped to SQL `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses. Note that the definition in the XML query
language now uses a `<limit>` element instead of the previous `<count>` element.
* Improved SQL query builder to create more concise SQL statements.

##### Fixes
* Fixed memory leak for large exports under PostgreSQL.
* Fixed OpenStreetMap data not showing in the map window. [#97](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/97)
* Fixed NPE when importing invalid xAL address elements. [#103](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/103)
* Fixed NPE when exporting PlantCover features as KML/COLLADA/glTF. [#91](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/91)
* Fixed memory issue due to re-opening of ZIP files in CityGML imports.
* Fixed import of curve geometries. If a curve geometry was given by several curve segments, then the
interior start and end points of the segments were imported into the database. This has been corrected.
* Fixed the `IzPack` library to support automated install scripts.

##### Miscellaneous 
* Updated to latest versions of the ADE manager plugin and the Spreadsheet Generator plugin.
* Updated to latest PostgreSQL driver v42.2.10.
* Updated to latest Oracle driver 19.3.
* Updated citygml4j to 2.10.5.
* Updated sqlbuilder to 2.2.1.

### 4.2.2 - 2019-08-06

##### Additions
* Added config option to suppress the product information header comment. 

##### Changes
* Moved input and output file information from internal config to external API.

### 4.2.1 - 2019-04-17

##### Additions
* Added the `-pid-file` command-line argument to create a file storing the process ID of the Importer/Exporter at the 
provided path. This can be useful to check whether the Importer/Exporter is running or to issue a `kill` command to end it.
* Added GUI warning dialogs if a Importer/Exporter module does not support ADEs registered in the database.
* Updated Spreadsheet Plugin to version 3.1.2.
* Updated ADE Manager Plugin to version 1.1.2.
* Updated 3DCityDB-Web-Map to version 1.7.1.

##### Fixes
* Added `distinct` to complex SQL queries to avoid exporting duplicates of a top-level feature.
* Fixed memory leak when importing ZIP files.
* Fixed database schema mapping to correctly support qualified XML attributes in CityGML and ADE XML schemas.
* Fixed NPE in XPath parser.

### 4.2 - 2019-02-13

##### Additions
* Reworked Plugin API to support non-GUI plugins. [#78](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/pull/78)
  * Added `CityGMLExportExtension` as a first non-GUI extension point for plugins. Using this extension, a plugin receives
  and can process all CityGML features before they are written to the output file. Besides using XSLT stylesheets
  for CityGML exports, this adds another way of having full control over the output.
  * Due to the changes to the Plugin API, make sure to only use plugins built for this version.
* Property projections can now also be defined for abstract feature types.
* Added possibility to define a gml:id prefix for the UUIDs that are created during CityGML imports.
* Added config options to control the writing of `gml:Envelope` elements on features and the root `CityModel`.
* Added config options to define XML prefixes and schema locations for the CityGML output file.

##### Fixes
* Fixed broken feature type filter for CityGML imports. [#75](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/75)
* Fixed NPE in `GeometryConverter` when using affine transformations during CityGML imports. [#77](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/77)
* The CLI version of the Importer/Exporter now returns an exit code of 1 on failures.

##### Miscellaneous 
* Updated citygml4j to 2.9.1.

### 4.1 - 2019-01-09

##### Additions
* Added support for using SQL queries and XML-based filter expressions in CityGML exports. Please refer to the documentation
to learn more about the new filter capabilities.
* Added support for importing CityGML data from ZIP/GZIP files and for exporting CityGML content to ZIP/GZIP files. [#62](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/62), 
[#63](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/63)
* Added a counter and a progress bar to spreadsheet exports. [#50](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/50)

##### Changes
* Due to changes in the Google Maps API license and usage terms, the Google services now require an API key
([read more here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key)). This affects the map window
and the KML/COLLADA/glTF export of the Importer/Exporter, where Google services are used for address searches and for
retrieving height values from the Google Earth terrain model. [#61](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/61)
  * If you want to continue using the Goolge services, then enter your Google API key in the corresponding global preferences
    dialog that has been added in this release.
  * The map window now uses [OSM Nominatim](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim) as the default
    geocoding service, so no need for a Google API key.
  * Querying height values from the Google Earth terrain model in KML/COLLADA/glTF exports requires the Google Elevation
    service though. Simply deactivate this option if you do not have an API key.

##### Fixes
* When running on Java 9 or higher, the following warning was printed to the console: `WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.reflect.opt.Injector`.
This [JAXB](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-ri) issue has been resolved in this release by updating to 
[citygml4j 2.8.1](https://github.com/citygml4j/citygml4j).
* Fixed SQL error when querying the highest LOD of `PlantCover` objects in KML/COLLADA/glTF exports. [#72](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/72)
* Fixed error in spreadsheet exports when column titles have leading and trailing whitespaces. [#65](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/65)
* Fixed bug when using the Importer/Exporter installer in non-GUI installations. [#47](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/47), 
[#64](https://github.com/3dcitydb/importer-exporter/issues/64)
* Fixed NPE when using a local cache for CityGML exports.
* Fixed NPE when exporting appearances without textures.
* Fixed CityGML writer to use default namespaces in tiled exports.

##### Miscellaneous 
* Upgrade to latest PostgreSQL driver v42.2.5 and PostGIS driver v2.3.0.
* Upgrade to latest Oracle driver 18.3.
