3. About
--------

The 3D City Database Import/Export Tool is a Java based front-end for 
the 3D City Database version 2.0. It allows for high-performance 
importing and exporting spatial data for a virtual 3d city model.

Main characteristics:
* Full support for CityGML version 1.0.0, 0.4.0, 0.3.1, and 0.3.0
* Reading/Writing CityGML instance documents of arbitrary file size
* Multithreaded programming facilitating high-performance CityGML processing
* Support for CityGML appearances such as textures
* Resolving of Xlinks

The 3D City Database Import/Export Tool is shipped with both a Graphical
User Interface (GUI) for end-user interaction and a Command Line 
Interface (CLI). The latter one allows for employing the tool in batch 
processing workflows or embedding its functionality into third party
programs.     


4. System requirements
----------------------

* Java JRE or JDK >= 1.6
* 3D City Database version 2.0 on an Oracle Spatial DBMS >= 10G R2

5. Installation
---------------

There is no installation necessary.

The subfolders /lib and /config of this package have to be in the same folder
as the impexp.jar.

For running the 3D Database Import/Export tool use one of the following 
options:

a) Recommended:
   * Edit the starter scripts according to your needs (in particular, 
     adapt the memory limits). Included are the following starter scripts:
     - start_unix.sh (use for UNIX/Linux and derivates, MacOS, etc.)
     - start_win.bat (use for MS Windows family, tested for XP) 
   * Double click onto the starter script.
   
c) Open a Shell and type the following: java -jar impexp.jar [-options]
   Again, define the memory limits for the JVM. This is the recommended
   way to use the CLI version of the program. See the starter scripts
   for further examples. Type 'java -jar impexp.jar -help' to get
   a list of supported command line parameters.

b) Double click onto the impexp.jar file. However, this is not the recommended
   way of starting the application since you may quickly run into heap space
   memory lacks due to JVM default values.
