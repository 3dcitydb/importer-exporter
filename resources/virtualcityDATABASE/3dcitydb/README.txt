3. About
--------

The virtualcityDATABASE is a free 3D geo database to store, represent, and
manage virtual 3D city models on top of a standard spatial relational
database. The database model contains semantically rich, hierarchically
structured, multi-scale urban objects facilitating complex GIS modeling and
analysis tasks, far beyond visualization. The schema of the virtualcityDATABASE
is based on the City Geography Markup Language (CityGML), an international
standard for representing and exchanging virtual 3D city models issued
by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

The virtualcityDATABASE has been realized as Oracle Spatial/Locator and
PostgreSQL/PostGIS database schema, supporting following key features:

    * Full support for CityGML versions 2.0.0 and 1.0.0
    * Complex thematic modelling
    * Five different Levels of Detail (LODs)
    * Appearance information (textures and materials)
    * Digital terrain models (DTMs)
    * Representation of generic and prototypical 3D objects
    * Free, also recursive aggregation of geo objects
    * Flexible 3D geometries
        
The virtualcityDATABASE enhances the 3D City Database
with advanced data management functionality.

The virtualcityDATABASE comes as a collection of SQL scripts that allow
for creating and dropping database instances.


4. System requirements
----------------------

* Oracle DBMS >= 10g R2 with Spatial or Locator option
* PostgreSQL DBMS >= 9.1 with PostGIS extension >= 2.0


5. Database setup
-----------------

To create a new database instance of the virtualcityDATABASE, simply execute
the SQL script "CREATE_DB.sql", which is available for both Oracle and
PostgreSQL and can be found in the respective subfolder of the distribution
package. The script will start the setup procedure and invoke additional
scripts in the background.

The execution of the script substantially differs for Oracle and PostgreSQL.
Please refer to the documentation of the virtualcityDATABASE for a
comprehensive step-by-step installation guide.

The setup procedure requires the following mandatory user inputs:
1) Spatial Reference Identifier for newly created geometry objects (SRID),
2) Corresponding GML conformant URN encoding for gml:srsName attributes.

For Oracle, two additional inputs are required:
3) Decision whether the database instance should be versioning enabled,
4) Whether the Oracle DBMS runs with Locator or Spatial option.


6. Database deletion
--------------------

To drop an existing database instance of the virtualcityDATABASE, simply execute
the SQL script "DROP_DB.sql" for your database system (Oracle or PostgreSQL).
Please refer to the PDF documentation of the 3D City Database for a
comprehensive step-by-step guide.


7. Documentation
----------------

A comprehensive documentation on the virtualcityDATABASE is provided in the
distribution package.
