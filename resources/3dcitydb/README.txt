3. About
--------

The 3D City Database is a free 3D geo database to store, represent, and
manage virtual 3D city models on top of a standard spatial relational
database. The database model contains semantically rich, hierarchically
structured, multi-scale urban objects facilitating complex GIS modeling and
analysis tasks, far beyond visualization. The schema of the 3D City Database
is based on the City Geography Markup Language (CityGML), an international
standard for representing and exchanging virtual 3D city models issued
by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

The 3D City Database has been realized as an Oracle 10G R2 Spatial relational
database schema (or higher), supporting following key features:

    * Complex thematic modelling
    * Five different Levels of Detail (LODs)
    * Appearance data
    * Digital terrain models (DTMs)
    * Representation of generic and prototypical 3D objects
    * Free, also recursive aggregation of geo objects
    * Flexible 3D geometries
    * Version and history management

The 3D City Database is shipped as a collection of SQL scripts which allow
for creating and dropping database instances.

The 3D City Database Version 3.0.0 was developed in collaboration of the Chair of 
Geoinformatics, Technische Universität München (TUMGI), virtualcitySYSTEMS GmbH, and 
M.O.S.S. Computer Grafik Systeme GmbH. The previous version of the the 3D City Database 
was implemented on behalf of the Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Wirtschaft, Arbeit und
Frauen and the Berlin Partner GmbH. The development is continuing the work of the Institute 
for Geodesy and Geoinformation Science (IGG), TU Berlin, and the Institute for Cartography and 
Geoinformation (IKG), University of Bonn. Please find the previous versions of the database 
at http://www.3dcitydb.net/.


4. System requirements
----------------------

* Oracle Spatial 10g R2, 11g, 12c
* PostgreSQL 9.1+ with PostGIS 2.0+


5. Database setup
-----------------

To create a new database instance of the 3D City Database call the SQL script 
"CREATE_DB.sql" which can be found in the top-level SQL folder of the 
distribution package. This script will start the setup procedure and invoke 
further scripts in the background.

The setup procedure requires three mandatory user inputs:
1) Spatial Reference Identifier for newly created geometry objects (SRID),
2) corresponding GML conformant URN encoding for gml:srsName attributes, and
3) decision whether the database instance should be versioning enabled.


6. Database deletion
--------------------

To drop an existing database instance of the 3D City Database call the SQL script
"DROP_DB.sql" which can be found in the top-level SQL folder of the 
distribution package.


7. Documentation
----------------

A comprehensive documentation on the 3D City Database can be found
on the project's website at http://www.3dcitydb.net/3dcitydb/documentation/
