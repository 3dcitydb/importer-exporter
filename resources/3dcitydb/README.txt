3. About
--------

The 3D City Database is a free 3D geo database to store, represent, and
manage virtual 3D city models on top of a standard spatial relational
database. The database model contains semantically rich, hierarchically
structured, multi-scale urban objects facilitating complex GIS modeling and
analysis tasks, far beyond visualization. The schema of the 3D City Database
is based on the City Geography Markup Language (CityGML), an international
standard for representing and exchanging virtual 3D city models issued
by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

The 3D City Database has been realized as Oracle Spatial/Locator and
PostgreSQL/PostGIS database schema, supporting following key features:

    * Full support for CityGML versions 2.0.0 and 1.0.0
    * Complex thematic modelling
    * Five different Levels of Detail (LODs)
    * Appearance information (textures and materials)
    * Digital terrain models (DTMs)
    * Representation of generic and prototypical 3D objects
    * Free, also recursive aggregation of geo objects
    * Flexible 3D geometries
	
The 3D City Database comes as a collection of SQL scripts that allow
for creating and dropping database instances.

The 3D City Database is an open source project and a joint development 
of the cooperation partners:
    * Chair of Geoinformatics, Technische Universität München,
    * virtualcitySYSTEMS GmbH, and 
    * M.O.S.S. Computer Grafik Systeme GmbH. 

In 2012, the 3D City Database received the Oracle Spatial Excellence Award
for Education and Research.


4. System requirements
----------------------

* Oracle DBMS >= 10g R2 with Spatial or Locator option
* PostgreSQL DBMS >= 9.1 with PostGIS extension >= 2.0


5. Database setup
-----------------

To create a new database instance of the 3D City Database, simply execute
the SQL script "CREATE_DB.sql", which is available for both Oracle and
PostgreSQL and can be found in the respective subfolder of the distribution
package. The script will start the setup procedure and invoke additional
scripts in the background.

The execution of the script substantially differs for Oracle and PostgreSQL.
Please refer to the documentation of the 3D City Database for a
comprehensive step-by-step installation guide.

The setup procedure requires the following mandatory user inputs:
1) Spatial Reference Identifier for newly created geometry objects (SRID),
2) Corresponding GML conformant URN encoding for gml:srsName attributes.

For Oracle, two additional inputs are required:
3) Decision whether the database instance should be versioning enabled,
4) Whether the Oracle DBMS runs with Locator or Spatial option. 


6. Database deletion
--------------------

To drop an existing database instance of the 3D City Database, simply execute
the SQL script "DROP_DB.sql" for your database system (Oracle or PostgreSQL).
Please refer to the PDF documentation of the 3D City Database for a
comprehensive step-by-step guide.


7. Documentation
----------------

A complete and comprehensive documentation on the 3D City Database is provided
in the distribution package and can be downloaded from the project's website at
http://www.3dcitydb.org/3dcitydb/documentation/
