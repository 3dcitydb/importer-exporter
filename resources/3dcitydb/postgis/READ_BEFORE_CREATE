Hello! Exited to work with the 3DCityDB in PostGIS 2.0?

The creation of the database is handled by the psql-console of PostgreSQL.
But no worries, you don't have to use the console directly as you can use a batch-file.
Before you doubleclick it, you have to edit the file in a way that its suits to your environment:

set PGPORT = 5432 (this is the default port)

set PGHOST = localhost (this is the default db-server-address)

set PGUSER = postgres (this is the default superuser of PostgreSQL)

set PGPASSWORD = userPasswordHere

set THEDB = name of the empty database, you must have already created (e.g. with template_postgis20) in PGAdminIII or psql.  

set FILES = absolute path to the folder where you have found this file

set PGBIN= C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.1\bin (or similar to this one)


Edit the DROP_DB.bat in the same way.
The creation and dropping of the database should then run fast and correct.
The Database SRID and GMLSRSNAME have to be set in the prompt.
To change it afterwards you can use the function util_change_db_srid found in the geodb_pkg.schema.
To avoid any errors, loss of data or long waiting times this function should be run on an empty database. 

Have fun!
