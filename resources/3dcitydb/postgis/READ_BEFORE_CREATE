Hello! Exited to work with the 3DCityDB in PostGIS 2.0?

The creation of the database is handled by the psql-console of PostgreSQL.
But no worries, you don't have to use the console directly as you can use a batch-file.
Before you doubleclick it, you have to edit the file in a way that its suits to your environment:

set PGPORT = 5432 (this is the default port)

set PGHOST = your_host_address ('localhost' on local machine)

set PGUSER = your_username ('postgres' is the default superuser)

set THEDB = name of the empty database, you must have already created (e.g. with template_postgis20) in PGAdminIII or psql.  

set PGBIN= path_to_psql.exe (e.g. 'C:\PostgreSQL\9.1\bin' or 'C:\pgAdmin III\1.14')


Edit the DROP_DB.bat in the same way.
The creation and dropping of the database should then run fast and correct.
First you have to enter your user-password.
Then the Database SRID and GMLSRSNAME have to be set in the prompt.
To change it afterwards you can use the function util_change_db_srid found in the geodb_pkg.schema.
To avoid any errors, loss of data or long waiting times this function should be run on an empty database. 

Have fun!
