== 3D City Database for PostGIS ==      
							   
This is a short instruction you need to follow before creating the 3D City Database in PostGIS.
This release only works correctly with an PostgreSQL DBMS >= 9.0 with PostGIS Extension >= 2.0.

The creation of the database is handled by the psql-console of PostgreSQL.
It can be done via command line with the following command:
psql -h your_host_address -p 5432 -U your_username -d name_of_database -f "CREATE_DB.sql"

But you can also edit the batchfile CREATE_DB.bat in a way that its suits to your environment
to minimize the work with the command line. 
YOU NEED TO CREATE AN EMPTY POSTGIS-DATABASE FIRST!

Settings for batchfiles:

set PGPORT = 5432 (this is the default port)

set PGHOST = your_host_address ('localhost' on local machine)

set PGUSER = your_username ('postgres' is the default superuser)

set CITYDB = name of the already existing empty PostGIS-database  

set PGBIN  = path_to_psql.exe (e.g. 'C:\PostgreSQL\9.1\bin' or 'C:\pgAdmin III\1.14')

Edit DROP_DB.bat in the same way.
The creation and dropping of the database should then run fast and correct.
(Note that DROP_DB only deletes all parts of the 3D City Database but not the database itself)

When running the batchfile, you are first asked for your user-password.
Then the Database SRID and GMLSRSNAME have to be set in the prompt.
If no numeric value is set for the SRID-variable spatial columns can't be created. 
To change the reference system afterwards you can use the function util_change_db_srid found in the geodb_pkg.schema.
To avoid any errors, loss of data or long waiting times this function should be run on an empty database.
