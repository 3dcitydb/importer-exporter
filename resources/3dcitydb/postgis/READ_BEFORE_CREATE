Hello! Exited to work with the 3DCityDB in PostGIS 2.0?

The creation of the database is handled by the psql-console of PostgreSQL.
But no worries, you don't have to use the console directly as you can use a batch-file.

WAIT! Before you doubleclick it, you have to edit the file in a way that its suits to your environment:

set PGPORT = 5432 (this is the default port)

set PGHOST = localhost (this is the default db-server-address)

set PGUSER = postgres (this is the default superuser of PostgreSQL)

set PGPASSWORD = yourPGpassword

set THEDB = name of the empty database, you must have already created (with template_postgis20) in PGAdminIII or psql.  

set FILES = absolute path to the folder where you have found this file

set PGBIN= C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.1\bin (or similar to this one)


Edit the DROP_DB.bat in the same way.
The creation and dropping of the database should then run fast and correct.

Have fun!
