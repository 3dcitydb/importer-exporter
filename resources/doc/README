3. About
--------

The !app.title! is a Java based front-end for 
the 3D City Database version 2.0. It allows for high-performance 
importing and exporting spatial data for a virtual 3D city model.

Main characteristics:
* Full support for CityGML version 1.0.0, 0.4.0, 0.3.1, and 0.3.0
  (the latter two only for reading)
* Reading/writing CityGML instance documents of arbitrary file size
* Multithreaded programming facilitating high-performance CityGML 
  processing
* Support for CityGML appearances such as textures
* Resolving of XLinks
* XML validation of CityGML instance documents
* Matching/merging of building features within the database (optional)

The !app.title! is shipped with both a Graphical
User Interface (GUI) for end-user interaction and a Command Line 
Interface (CLI). The latter one allows for employing the tool in batch 
processing workflows or embedding its functionality into third party
programs.     


4. System requirements
----------------------

* Java JRE or JDK >= 1.6.0_05
* 3D City Database version 2.0 on an Oracle Spatial DBMS >= 10G R2
  (version 2.0.1 is mandatory for matching/merging functionality)


5. (Un)Installation
-------------------

It is recommended to use the universal installer to unpack the 
!app.title! application files to your local 
computer. Afterwards, you can immediately run the application.

Once unpacked, you can always copy & paste the application files to any
other location without using the universal installer. However, please make
sure that at least the following subfolders and their contents are in the 
same folder as the !app.jar!:

--(parent folder)
  `--lib
  `--schemas
  `--config
  `--log
  !app.jar!

There is no uninstallation routine needed to remove the 
!app.title!. Simply delete all application 
files from your local computer.


6. Running the application
--------------------------

For running the !app.title! use one of the 
following options:

a) Recommended:
   * Edit the starter scripts according to your needs (in particular, 
     adapt the memory limits). Included are the following starter scripts:
     - start_unix.sh (use for UNIX/Linux and derivates, MacOS X, etc.)
     - start_win.bat (use for MS Windows family, tested for XP and Vista) 
   * Execute the starter script (for example by double-clicking on it)
   
b) Open a shell and type the following: 
       java -jar !app.jar! [-options]
   Again, define the memory limits for the JVM. This is the recommended
   way to use the CLI version of the program. See the starter scripts
   for further examples. Type 'java -jar !app.jar! -help' to get
   a list of supported command line parameters.

c) Double click onto the !app.jar! file. However, this is not 
   the recommended way of starting the application since you may quickly 
   run into heap space memory lacks due to JVM default values.
