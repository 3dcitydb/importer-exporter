5. (Un)Installation
-------------------

The plugin is shipped as a precompiled and ready-to-use ZIP package
called "plugin-spreadsheet-generator-3.1.3.zip".

The following simple steps will guide you through the install process:
* Open the installation directory of your local installation of the
  3D City Database Importer/Exporter version 4.2.3.
* Open the "plugins" subfolder. If it is not available, create a new
  subfolder and name it "plugins".
* Extract the downloaded ZIP file in the plugins folder. As a result a new
  folder named "plugin-spreadsheet-generator-3.1.3" will be created. This
  folder will contain all required files and subfolders.
* Run the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter.

If you want to uninstall the Spreadsheet Generator Plugin, simply delete
the "plugin-spreadsheet-generator-3.1.3" subfolder and all its contents.
