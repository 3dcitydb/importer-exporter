3. About
--------

By using the ADE Manager Plugin, it is possible to export
data from a 3D City Database instance into tables. Supported output
formats are Microsoft Excel and CSV.


4. Requirements
---------------

This version of the ADE Manager Plugin shall only be used with
version 1.0.0 of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter.
It cannot be guaranteed that the extension does correctly work with any
previous or later version of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter.


5. (Un)Installation
-------------------

The plugin is shipped as a precompiled and ready-to-use ZIP package
called "plugin-ade-manager-1.0.0.zip".

The following simple steps will guide you through the install process:
* Open the installation directory of your local installation of the
  3D City Database Importer/Exporter version 1.0.0.
* Open the "plugins" subfolder. If it is not available, create a new
  subfolder and name it "plugins".
* Extract the downloaded ZIP file in the plugins folder. As a result a new
  folder named "plugin-ade-manager-1.0.0" will be created. This
  folder will contain all required files and subfolders.
* Run the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter.

If you want to uninstall the ADE Manager Plugin, simply delete
the "plugin-ade-manager-1.0.0" subfolder and all its contents.
