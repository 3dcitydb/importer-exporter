3. About
--------

By using the SPSHG (Spreadsheet Generator) plugin, it is possible to export 
data from a 3D City Database (3DCityDB) instance into tables. Supported 
output formats are Microsoft Excel, CSV, and Google Spreadsheets. 


4. Requirements
---------------

This version of the Spreadsheet Generator Plugin shall only be used with
version 3.0 of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter. 
It cannot be guaranteed that the extension does correctly work with any
previous or later version of the 3D City Database Importer/Exporter.


5. (Un)Installation
-------------------

The plugin is shipped as a precompiled and ready-to-use JAR package
called "spreadsheet_generator.jar". Following simple steps will guide you 
through the install process:  

* Open the folder that contains your locally installed instance of the
  Importer/Exporter version 3.0.0 (the installation directory).
* Open the plugins subfolder. If it is not available, create a new subfolder
  and name it "plugins". 
* Extract the downloaded zip file in the plugins folder. As a result a new
  folder named "spreadsheet_generator" will be created. The 
  spreadsheet_generator folder will contain all required files and 
  subfolders.
* Run the Importer/Exporter.

If you want to uninstall the Spreadsheet Generator Plugin, simply delete
the "spreadsheet" subfolder and all its contents.
